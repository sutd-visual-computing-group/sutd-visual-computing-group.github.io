  description: Visual counterfeits are increasingly causing an existential conundrum in mainstream media with rapid evolution in neural 
                image synthesis methods. Though detection of such counterfeits has been a taxing problem in the image forensics community, 
                a recent class of forensic detectors — universal detectors — are able to surprisingly spot counterfeit images regardless of 
                generator architectures, loss functions, training datasets, and resolutions. This intriguing property suggests the possible 
                existence of transferable forensic features (T-FF) in universal detectors. In this work, we conduct the first analytical 
                study to discover and understand T-FF in universal detectors. 
                Our contributions are 2-fold&#58; 1) We propose a novel forensic feature relevance statistic (FF-RS) to quantify and discover 
                T-FF in universal detectors and, 2) Our qualitative and quantitative investigations uncover an unexpected finding&#58; color is a critical 
                T-FF in universal detectors. Code and models are available at this https://keshik6.github.io/transferable-forensic-features/

- title: "Revisiting Label Smoothing and Knowledge Distillation Compatibility: What was Missing?"

  description: This work investigates the compatibility between label smoothing (LS) and knowledge distillation (KD). 
                Contemporary findings addressing this thesis statement take dichotomous standpoints&#58; Muller et al. (2019) and Shen et al. (2021b). 
                Critically, there is no effort to understand and resolve these contradictory findings, 
                leaving the primal question — to smooth or not to smooth a teacher network? — unanswered. 
                The main contributions of our work are the discovery, analysis and validation of systematic diffusion as the missing 
                concept which is instrumental in understanding and resolving these contradictory findings. 
                This systematic diffusion essentially curtails the benefits of distilling from an LS-trained teacher, 
                thereby rendering KD at increased temperatures ineffective. Our discovery is comprehensively supported by 
                large-scale experiments, analyses and case studies including image classification, neural machine translation and 
                compact student distillation tasks spanning across multiple datasets and teacher-student architectures. Based on our 
                analysis, we suggest practitioners to use an LS-trained teacher with a low-temperature transfer to achieve high 
                performance students. Code and models are available at https://keshik6.github.io/revisiting-ls-kd-compatibility/
